# 💎 Diamond Analysis Project

This project analyzes diamond pricing in relation to the *4Cs* — *Carat weight, Cut, Color, and Clarity* — using data from leading online diamond vendors. The study compares *natural vs. lab-grown diamonds* and builds predictive regression models to understand the most influential factors in diamond pricing.

## 📌 Project Overview
- *Course:* MSBA 210 – Business Analytics  
- *Instructor:* Dr. Chong Huang, Ph.D.  
- *Contributors:* Aryan Vimalbhai Shah, Krish Vijaykumar Modi, Krutika Gordhanbhai Vekariya  

The main objective was to:
- Build a *regression model* to predict diamond prices using the 4Cs.  
- Compare *natural diamonds* with *lab-grown diamonds*.  
- Create a *Rapaport-style report* for diamonds sized between *0.50 and 0.69 carats*.  
- Visualize pricing patterns with dashboards, pivot tables, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

## 🔍 Key Analyses
- *Descriptive Statistics* – Mean, range, mode, standard deviation, quartiles.  
- *Pivot Tables* – For natural vs. lab-grown diamond comparisons.  
- *Heatmaps* – Visual comparison with Rapaport report.  
- *Regression Models* – Price prediction based on 4Cs.  
- *Scatter Plots* – Relationship between carat and price.  
- *Dashboards* – Interactive visualization with bar charts and cluster column charts.

## 📈 Findings
- *Carat weight* is the strongest determinant of price.  
- Followed by: *Color → Clarity → Cut*.  
- *Lab-grown diamonds* are significantly cheaper than natural ones, though the gap is narrowing.  
- Visualization tools (pivot tables, scatter plots, heatmaps) revealed hidden trends and market differences.
